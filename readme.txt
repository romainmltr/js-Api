Hello This my site API we have 2 api :
    -"https://www.themealdb.com/api.php"      
    -"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php"



I used Fetch to get the information from the api 

Then response  to  get the json from the api;
i used .map to get the information from the array api .
Next  i created the html with  InnerHTML i call the information i want
and i run the function.
Same for the other APi.

function cocktailCollection is used to get different
information who will sort the different alcool .
i use selectinput.innerHTML to put in the select the informations
with the values.

Next function fetchCocktailByType
to look in the api what is ingredients i have .
same map with the container.innerHTML

I use event listener to check change on Cocktail Select Input
to switch and change my page when i click in my select.

Same 


For my Random button i done just a call api and with random function from my
api and container.innerHTML to pin up.
